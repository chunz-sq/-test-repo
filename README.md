# Summary

This chart visualizes the percent distribution of flights arriving on-time at the ten most busiest US airports from 2003 to 2014 against US GDP per Capita. It illustrates the performances of these airports over time where there is a marked dip from 2003 to 2007, at which point things improve and peak at 2012 and recent trends from 2012 to 2014 show a steady decline. It appears that airport performace as described by percent flights arriving on-time is negatively correlated with GDP per Capita in the United States.
